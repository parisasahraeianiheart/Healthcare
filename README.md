# Optimization in Healthcare

This repository contains a network optimization model to analyze and improve comorbidity progression in patients, inspired by graduate research.

## Description

The project uses optimization techniques to allocate limited healthcare resources to patients based on their comorbidity progression rates and severity levels. It leverages Python, Gurobi, and network optimization concepts.

## Features
- Analyze patient data to identify critical conditions.
- Optimize treatment allocation to minimize overall progression rates.
- Provide interpretable solutions using network optimization.
